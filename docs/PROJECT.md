## Overview

**Creon** is a web3 crowdfunding ("urun dana") platform for Indonesian micro, small,
and medium enterprises (UMKM), built on the **Stellar network**. It connects
entrepreneurs who lack or need capital with investors who want to fund them.

An entrepreneur submits a funding proposal for their business. Once an admin
approves it, a funding **campaign** is created on a Stellar smart contract, and
investors can fund that campaign. All investments are denominated in **USDC**
(using Stellar **testnet** during development).

## Actors / Roles

- **Entrepreneur (UMKM owner)** — Submits a funding proposal describing their
  business and how much capital they need.
- **Admin** — Reviews submitted proposals and approves or rejects them. Only
  approved proposals proceed on-chain.
- **Investor** — Browses approved, live campaigns and invests USDC into the ones
  they want to back.

## Core Flow (happy path)

1. **Submission** — An entrepreneur submits a UMKM funding proposal (off-chain).
2. **Review** — An admin reviews the proposal and approves or rejects it.
3. **Campaign creation** — On approval, a **campaign is created on a Stellar smart
   contract**, making it live and fundable.
4. **Pool creation** — Once approved, a **liquidity pool is created pairing the
   campaign's project token with USDC** (the investor capital). This pool
   represents the funded relationship between the business and its investors.
5. **Pool lock** — The pool is **locked for a defined period** so the business has
   stable capital while it is being built and ramped up; funds cannot be withdrawn
   from the pool until the lock period ends.
6. **Investment** — Investors fund the live campaign using **USDC**, which flows
   into the paired pool.
7. **Settlement** — Once the lock period ends and the campaign reaches its goal or
   ends, funds are settled according to the campaign's lifecycle rules (the exact
   settlement model is still to be defined).
